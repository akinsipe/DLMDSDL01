    "# Introduction to Tensors and TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using TensorFlow for neural networks and deep learning, we investigate that TensorFlow is a powerful library for\n",
    "mathematical operations and optimization \"under the hood\".\n",
    "Using a few simple examples we understand more about the variables used in Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief reminder of scalars, vectors and tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers are at the core of mathematics. In some scenarios, a simple number is sufficient, e.g. \"How many pieces of cake are there?\" - and you might answer \"6 (pieces of cake)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many situations a simple number is not sufficient, e.g. \"How far is it to your home\". Just answering \"3\" is not sufficient, we now need a _unit_, e.g. km: \"My house is 3 km from here. These numbers are called denominate numbers or **scalars**. Other examples are temperature, energy, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other situations more information is required than denominate numbers, e.g. answering the question \"How do I get to your house?\" In addition to a number, a direction is needed: \"Walk 3 km due north\". These numbers are **vectors**, other examples are velocity, momentum, ...\n",
    "Vectors are often represented by its components: $\\vec{v} = a * \\vec{i} + b * \\vec{j} + c *\\vec{k}$, where $\\vec{i}, \\vec{j}, \\vec{k}$ are the unit vectors (for example, in x,y,z direction in Eucledian space) and a,b,c are scalars denoting how far one has to go in each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "Vectors can be combined into new objects:\n",
    "* Sum: $\\vec{W} = \\vec{U} + \\vec{V}$\n",
    "The sum (or difference) of two vectors results in a new vector\n",
    "* Inner Product: $\\vec{U} + \\vec{V} = \\eta$\n",
    "The inner prduct results in a scalar, the inner product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude (length)\n",
    "* Cross Product: $\\vec{S} = \\vec{U} \\times \\vec{V}$\n",
    "Two vectors in 3-dimensional space can be combined into a new vector, where the resulting vector $\\vec{S}$ is perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}$ and its direction is given by the right-hand-rule.\n",
    "* Multiplied by scalar: A vector can be multiplied by a scalar to change its magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors\n",
    "If we start from a unit vector and want to change its properties, we have few options so far:\n",
    "* multiply with a scalar to change its magnitude\n",
    "* cross product with another (unit) vector to change its direction.\n",
    "However, this limits us to right angles - if we want to change both magnitude and direction of a vector, we need something else: **tensors** \n",
    "\n",
    "__Terminology__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalar: Tensor of rank 0 (magnitude only - 1 component)\n",
    "* Vector: Tensor of rank 1 (mangnitude and 1 direction - 3 components)\n",
    "* Dyad:   Tensor of rank 2 (magnigude and 2 directions - $3^2 = 9$ components)\n",
    "* Triad:  Tensor of rank 3 (magnitude and 3 directions - $3^3 = 27$ components)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dyad Product__\n",
    "\n",
    "A dyad can be constructed from two vectors by taking the product of the components term-by-term of each individual components and then add. The dyad product of two vectors $\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}$ is then simply $\\underline{UV} = \\vec{U} \\vec{V}$, which is neither a dot nor a cross product.\n",
    "If $\\vec{U}= u_1 \\vec{i} + u_2 \\vec{j} + u_3 \\vec{k}$ and $\\vec{V}= v_1 \\vec{i} + v_2 \\vec{j} + v_3 \\vec{k}$, the dyad product is given by $\\underline{UV} = u_1v_1 \\underline{ii} + u_1v_2 \\underline{ij} + u_1v_3\\underline{ik} + \\cdots$. Here, $\\vec{i}$, $\\vec{j}$, $\\vec{k}$ are unit vectors and $\\underline{ii}$, $\\underline{ij}$, etc are unit dyads.\n",
    "Setting $\\mu_{11} = u_1v_1$, $\\mu_{12} = u_1v_2$, the dyad product can be written as $\\underline{UV} =  \\mu_{11} \\underline{ii} +\\mu_{12} \\underline{ij} + \\mu_{13}\\underline{ik} + \\cdots$. The scalar components $\\mu_{ij}$ can be expressed as a matrix:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\mu_{11} & \\mu_{12} & \\mu_{12} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{21} & \\mu_{22} & \\mu_{22} \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_{31} & \\mu_{32} & \\mu_{32} \n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that the dyad product is generally not cummutative, i.e. $\\underline{UV}\\ne\\underline{VU}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Calculating with Tensors__\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating with dyads is similar to matrix operations, the rules are generally non communtative, i.e. the order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying with a scalar is defined as $a(\\underline{UV}) = (\\underline{UV})a$, i.e. pre- and postmultiplication give the same result\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product of a dyad $\\underline{UV}$ with another vector $\\vec{S}$ is defined as $\\vec{S}\\cdot (\\underline{UV})$ when we pre-multiply and $(\\underline{UV}) \\cdot \\vec{S}$ when we post-multiply.\n",
    "The order makes a difference: When we pre-multiply: $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\underline{UV} = (\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{U})\\vec{V} = \\sigma \\vec{V}$, i.e. the result is a vector with magnitude $\\sigma = \\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec(U)$ and direction of $\\vec{V}$. For post-multiplication, $\\underline{UV}\\cdot\\vec{S} = \\vec{U}(\\vec{V}\\cdot \\vec{S}) = \\lambda \\vec{U}$, i.e. a vector with magnitude $\\lambda = \\vec{V}\\cdot\\vec{S}$ in direction of $\\vec{U}$."
